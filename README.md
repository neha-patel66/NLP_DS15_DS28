Neural Machine Translation using Seq to Seq model (English -> Marathi).
For this project we require either Google Collab or Jupyter Notebook.
We have used Google Collab.
Install all the necessary libraries first to get the project going.
All the required libraries are mentioned in the code itself(.ipynb file).
Start with forming a neural network and an Encoder-Decoder model to translate a language.
The dataset we have used here is mar.txt, which contain all the english to marathi translations.
This dataset will be used by the model to learn and then predict an unknown sentence in marathi.
Then we have performed 50 Epochs on the model.
And finally testing it on 30 different English sentences, we got the correct Marathi translation.
